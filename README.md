# Music Player in React 🎶

This is a simple music player project developed with React. While it does not play music, it provides an interactive interface to navigate through a list of songs and view details of the selected song.

## Features

- **Song List**: A list of available songs is displayed on the left side of the interface.
- **Song Details**: When a song is selected from the list, its details are displayed on the right side.
- **Responsive and Modern Interface**: Built with React and contexts for an intuitive and smooth user experience.

## Live Demo
